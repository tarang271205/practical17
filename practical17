Program: 17 Display the seating arrangement in theatre using C program. The theater has a fixed 
number of rows and seats per row. Create a seating chart where each seat is 
identified by its row and seat number. Additionally, the program should allow the 
user to mark certain seats as reserved. The seating chart should be displayed with 
indicators showing which seats are reserved and which are available. 
Code: // Practical 17: Create Simple Ticket Booking Program. 
#include<stdio.h> 
void main() 
{ 
    int R,C,x,y;   //R=Row,C=Column,x=Number Of Seats For Book,y=Loop. 
   char Z[10][10]; //Shows The Seating Chart(10 rows and 10 columns). 
 
        // Shows The Seating Chart With 'o' To Show That Seat Is Available. 
        for(R=0;R<10;R++) 
        { 
            for(C=0;C<10;C++) 
            { 
                Z[R][C]='o';// For Show Seat Is Available. 
            } 
        } 
    printf("Enter Number Of Seat That You Wants To Buy::");// To Know How Many Seats Users 
Want. 
    scanf("%d",&x); 
    for (y=0;y<x;y++)  //Here This Loop Stands For Select Seat In Any Row. 
    { 
        printf("Enter Row And Seat Number That You Want To Select(Row,Seat) %d :",y+1); 
        scanf("%d",&R);
        // Select Row.
         scanf("%d",&C);// Select Column. 
            Z[R-1][C-1]=88;// Here 88 Is Binary Number Of X And It Shows That The Seat Is Confirm. 
    } 
    printf("\nChart Of Seating::\n"); 
    for(R=0;R<10;R++)// Here This Loop Stands For Shows The Seating Chart. 
    { 
        printf("ROW%d:",R+1); 
        for(C=0;C<10;C++) 
        { 
            printf(" %c",Z[R][C]); 
        } 
        printf("\n");// New Line After Each Row.
